			The Feroz Shah Kotla is a cricket ground located at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, Delhi. It was established in 1883 and is the second oldest international cricket stadium still functional in India, after the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. It is located close to the 20,000 capacity Ambedkar Stadium, the home of association football club New Delhi Heroes FC. In the 21st century, the Feroz Shah Kotla is famed for its cauldron-like atmosphere. The vociferous home support has led to a great winning sequence for India in Test matches, and the India national cricket team has been undefeated for over 20 years at this ground. The ground is most famously known for Anil Kumble's 10 wickets in an innings against Pakistan.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

			Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, India, is a multipurpose sports arena hosting football and other sporting events, as well as large-scale entertainment events.

In preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, the stadium reduced its capacity from 78,000 to 60,254 spectators.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
			<img src="images/65.jpg" width="30%"><br>&nbsp;</br><h4>Chandni Chowk</h4><br>&nbsp;</br>
			Chandni Chowk, a main marketplace in Delhi, keeps alive the city's living legacy of Shahjahanabad. Created by Shah Jahan the builder of Taj Mahal, the old city, with the Red Fort as its focal point and Jama Masjid as the praying centre, has a fascinating market called Chandni Chowk. Legend has it that Shah Jahan planned Chandni Chowk so that his daughter could shop for all that she wanted. The market was divided by canals. The canals are now closed, but Chandni Chowk remains Asia's largest wholesale market. Crafts once patronized by the Mughals continue to flourish there. Chowk is one of the oldest and busiest markets in central north Delhi, the Laal Quila (The Red Fort) and Fateh Puri Masjid. With the most famous mosque of Delhi Jama Masjid in the vicinity, along with Sis Ganj Gurudwara, Gauri Shankar Mandir, Jain Mandir and a lot of small temples, the place witnesses a genuine cultural harmony.<p>&nbsp;</p>
