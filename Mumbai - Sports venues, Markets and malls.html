The word chor means thief in Hindi and Marathi. The market is thought to have originally been called Shor Bazaar, meaning noisy market. The current name is said to have come from a British mispronunciation. Eventually however, stolen goods started finding their way into the market, resulting in it living up to its new name. According to popular legend, if you lose anything in Mumbai you can buy it back from the "Chor Bazaar". The market has been mentioned in popular novels, including Rohinton Mistry's Such a Long Journey, where it is described as "not a nice place".<p>&nbsp;</p>
