			The Rajabai Clock Tower was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, an English architect. He modeled it on the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster in London. The foundation stone was laid on 1 March 1869 and construction was completed in November 1878. The total cost of construction came to INR 200,000, a princely sum in those days. This entire cost was defrayed by Premchand Roychand, a prosperous broker who founded the Bombay Stock Exchange on the condition that the tower be named after his mother Rajabai. Premchand Roychand's mother was blind and as a staunch follower of Jain religion she was supposed to consume her dinner before evening. The evening bell of the tower helped her to know the time without anyone's help. The tower was closed to the public after it became a frequent spot for those attempting to commit suicide.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

			The India Government Mint, Mumbai is one of the four mints in India and is situated in the city of Mumbai . The Mint was established in 1829 by the then governor of the Bombay Presidency. The main activity of the mint is in the production of commemorative and development-oriented coins. The mint is situated just opposite the Reserve Bank of India in the Fort area of South Mumbai. Initially governed by the Governor of the Bombay Presidency, it was transferred to the Government of India on 18 May 1876 through a Finance Department Resolution 247. In 1918, a branch of the Royal Mint of London was set up to issue British sovereigns. In April 1919, after manufacturing 12.95 lakh (1.295 million) coins, it was shut down.<br>&nbsp;</br>Besides coins, the Mint also produces medals of various types, for Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, educational institutions, social service institutions, badges etc. It is also a centre for the issuance of gold ingots in exchange of unrefined gold tendered by licensed dealers.
