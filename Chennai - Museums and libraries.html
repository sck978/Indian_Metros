			<img src="images/11.jpg"><br>&nbsp;</br><h4>The National Art Gallery</h4><br>&nbsp;</br>
			The National Art Gallery situated in Egmore, Chennai, is one of the oldest art galleries in India. Constructed with red stones sourced from Satyavedu in Andhra Pradesh, the Gallery was built in 1906 in Indo-Sarsenic architecture and houses paintings from Thanjavur, Rajasthan, Kangra and Deccan areas, as well as sandalwood sculptures.

			Elliot's Beach (popularly known as "Besant Nagar Beach" or "Bessie") is located in Besant Nagar, Chennai, India. It forms the end-point of the Marina Beach shore, and is named after Edward Elliot, Governor of Madras. It has the Velankanni Church and the Ashtalakshmi Kovil nearby. In the colonial era, it was a fairly exclusive place limited to ex-patriates.The beach is a prominent hang-out zone for most of the college-going crowd in Chennai. On weekends, it becomes quite an experience to find parking space on the beach roads. The beach also has found importance with families, who now no longer travel to the famous Marina Beach. There are many restaurants near the beach.A prominent landmark on this beach is the Karl Schmidt Memorial. The memorial is named after the Dutch sailor who lost his life in the process of saving a drowning swimmer.<br>&nbsp;</br>Elliot's Beach is one of the cleanest beaches in the city of Chennai. It is located towards the south of Marina Beach and was an extremely calm and tranquil place. As the beach does not offer much activity, it is ideal for long walks. Moreover, the ones who want to soak their feet in the splashing sea water and lose themselves completely in the arms of the nature, head on. Elliot's Beach is quite a hit amongst both the tourists as well as the natives of Tamil Nadu.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
			<img src="images/50.jpg"><br>&nbsp;</br><h4>Marina Beach</h4><br>&nbsp;</br>
			Marina Beach is a natural urban beach in the city of Chennai, India, along the Bay of Bengal, part of the Indian Ocean. The beach runs from near Fort St. George in the north to Besant Nagar in the south, a distance of 13 km (8.1 mi), making it the longest natural urban beach in the country and the world's second longest. The Marina is primarily sandy, unlike the short, rocky formations that make up the Juhu Beach in Mumbai. The average width of the beach is 300 m (980 ft) and the width at the widest stretch is 437 m (1,434 ft). Bathing and swimming at the Marina Beach are legally prohibited because of the dangers, as the undercurrent is very turbulent. It is the most crowded beach in the country and attracts about 30,000 visitors a day during weekdays and 50,000 visitors a day during the weekends and on holidays. During summer months, about 15,000 to 20,000 people visit the beach daily. Memorials for C. N. Annadurai and M. G. Ramachandran, former Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, are present on the northern end of the promenade known as the Anna Square.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
